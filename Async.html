// The above example shows problem with the sync javascript. It blocks the code until it finishes the code that is currently in process by the main thread as Javascript is a single threaded language
// To solve this problem we can use web workers or most modern we can use Async JS

// Async code allows the program to run immediately without blocking any other code that is being executed currently by the main thread.

//  So functions running in parallel with other functions are called Async.

// A typical example will be serTimeout

setTimeout(fu, 3000);

function fu(){
  console.log("I am late three seconds")
}

console.log ("I am early")
